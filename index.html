                A Waste-Free society is committed for transforming our current linear economy into a circular one, working towards a society without waste. Despite recycling efforts dating back nearly 1,000 years, beginning with paper recycling in Japan, the global recycling rate has only reached 19% only. 
                <br>EcoExchangeIndia aims to address the fundamental challenges behind this stagnation, leveraging existing technologies to significantly boost recycling rates, improving the sanitization system ,for a cleaner and greener society.
